This file replaces the standard CSS file for Gedit or a gtksourceview text editor. It adds support for all CSS3 properties.

_Note: I haven't used Ubuntu as my primary development OS since 11.10. I'm not sure if this is needed on the later versions._

### Installation and Use

1. Download and place .lang file in `/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs` or `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs` for Ubuntu 11.10 (not sure about anything later). Replace the existing css.lang file.

2. Restart or run Gedit and open any of your CSS3-inclusive files.

3. Smile because your CSS3 doesn't look like a sore thumb anymore.

### Credits

Thanks to W3Schools for listing all the CSS3 properties that I added by hand.
